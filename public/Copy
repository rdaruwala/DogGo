Givers are pivotal figures in keeping pets from animal shelters. You may register to be a Giver if you own a pet that you are no longer interested in living with. By registering as a Giver, you will automatically receive notifications of Adopters that have an interest in the pet profile you have submitted. Upon agreeing to collaborate with Adopters, you acknowledge that they have the decision to request permanent ownership of your pet. Deciding to become a Giver when you are no longer interested in, or no longer capable of supporting a pet is incredibly important. When pets are abandoned, they are often emotionally traumatized and may face death due to environmental hazards. In becoming a Giver, you are not only providing a life-changing opportunity to your former pet, but also prospective pet owners.

Adopters are prospective pet owners that are looking to temporarily or permanently house a previously owned pet as to prevent them from being homeless or delivered to an animal shelter. As an adopter, you will have the opportunity to live with a Giver’s pet for a select period of time and you may request to extend the animal’s stay with you, either temporarily, or permanently, with the consent of the Giver. Being an Adopter will grant you the valuable experience of caretaking for an animal, to act as a testament of whether one believes a pet is right for them. If you are an individual looking to house a pet permanently, but have not had the experience in doing so, becoming an Adopter will allow you to definitively understand whether you would like to make such a long-term commitment.

Givers
You will:
-> Temporarily allow a prospective pet owner to take care of your pet and potentially have the opportunity to fully give your pet into the Adopter’s custody
-> Have the opportunity to temporarily, or permanently live without your pet, to help decide if that is the decision you are interested in
-> Allow your pet to continue living in a safe household environment even after leaving your custody

Adopters
You will:
-> Temporarily receive a pet from a Giver and have the option to request permanent ownership of it
-> Fully experience living with a pet to help decide whether supporting a pet is a commitment you are willing to make
-> Provide a safe haven for a pet that otherwise could potentially have been homeless
